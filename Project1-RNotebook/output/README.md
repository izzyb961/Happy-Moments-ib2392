Happy Moments Project
Applied Data Science

For my analysis of these happy moments, I was interested in categorizing these moments based on whether it was mainly a social event or an individual event.  After I classified each moment into one of those categories, I did an analysis on it.  This data showed that there are slightly more individual moments in this dataset than social moments, but it is pretty close to equal.  The groups that are more likely to highlight a social moment in the past 24 hours are females, older people, married people, parents, and people that do not live in the USA.  The other groups tended to talk more about individual moments.  Most people did not include any names in their moments, even when describing social events, but for the moments that did include names, only half of them actually referred to social events; for the rest, the names were used to describe movie titles, celebrities, or company names, or were names that are also common everyday words (jack, sunny, miles).
